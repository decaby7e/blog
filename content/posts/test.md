Every blog should have a first post, so here's mine!
This blog was created in December of 2019 by Jack Polk.
In this site, I hope to write about my ongoing, past, and future projects, give tutorials on programming and Linux related systems, and share any useful information I can find.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello world!"

exit 0
```

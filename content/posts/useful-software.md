A common theme in this catalogue of software is that most entries here are good looking, lightweight, and easy to install (with Docker). Please send me any suggestions for additions should you have any!

# Ubuntu Customizations

For my personal desktop, I run the latest distribution of Ubuntu, which at the time of writing is 19.10. On here, I have some minor customizations that vastly improve my QoL:

 - [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) - An amazing dock solution that is dead simple and aesthetically pleasing
 - [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) - System monitor program that is complicated to configure but reliable and simple when its up and running
 - [PopOS GNOME Shell Theme](https://github.com/pop-os/gnome-shell-theme) - All the beauty of PopOS along with the vanilla experience of good ol' Ubuntu
 - [Papirus Icon Pack](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) - Ubuntu icons are getting better but Papirus still has my heart
 - [Dotfiles](https://github.com/decaby7e/dotfiles) - Dotfiles that I use for customization across my machines
 - [Arronax](https://www.florian-diesch.de/software/arronax/) - Program for creating and modifying .desktop files

## ![Desktop Screenshot](/img/neon-screenshot.png)

_NOTE_: Recently, I have tried most of the vanilla options on Ubuntu 19.10 and have been very pleased with the default gnome-shell theme. Therefore, I have elected to only use the [Papirus Icon Pack](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) as a customization.

# Privacy Tools

Brought to you by NordVPN! Buy today and save 50% on the ammount of information we record rather than letting your ISP record it.

# Development Tools

For development, here are the bare essentials for any system:

 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The result of Microsoft making an actually good program
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker > VMs

### Windows Specific Applications

Windows doesn't come with all the features that Ubuntu comes with, so I add some additional tools to make it feel more like home:

 - [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - I find this to be the best SSH client for Windows
 - [Ubuntu for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6) - Good for when you don't want to run a full Ubuntu VM to get some dev work done on Windows (is also compatible with VS Code)
 - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) - A nice barebones text editor for Windows
 - [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) - I prefer virt-manager but this is what you get with Windows...
 - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) - Nice simple SFTP client for Windows
